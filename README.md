### Content-Based Movie Recommendation System with Sentiment Analysis

#### Overview:

This advanced movie recommendation system leverages multiple technologies like Python, Flask, and various APIs to provide a nuanced recommendation. It gathers comprehensive information about a range of movies and uses both metadata and sentiment analysis of user reviews for personalized suggestions.

#### Technologies Used:

- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and analytics.
- **Flask**: Web framework for deploying the recommendation system.
- **themoviedb.org API**: For fetching movie details like title, runtime, rating, and poster images.
- **Wikipedia API**: For additional movie context and details.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the content-based recommendation model.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: For sentiment analysis on user reviews.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**: For frontend development.

#### How it Works:

1. **Data Extraction**:
    - Movie details are fetched from themoviedb.org API.
    - Additional information is pulled from Wikipedia using its API.

2. **Feature Compilation**:
    - Creates a 'feature vector' for each movie, including genres, director, main actors, etc.
    - User reviews are fetched and sentiment analysis is performed.

3. **Content-Based Filtering**:
    - A cosine similarity matrix is generated using Scikit-learn.
    - Sentiment scores from user reviews are integrated into this similarity matrix.

4. **Recommendation**:
    - The system finds the most similar movies based on the modified cosine similarity matrix.
    - It returns a list of recommended movies sorted by their similarity scores.

#### Additional Features:

- **Auto-Suggest**: Suggests possible matches while typing a movie name.
- **Interactive UI**: Displays each recommended movie with its poster, and more details upon clicking.

#### Benefits:

- **Personalized**: Sentiment analysis adds an emotional tone to the recommendations.
- **Comprehensive**: Multi-source data gathering for well-rounded recommendations.
- **Dynamic**: Constantly evolving recommendations based on new user reviews.

## Running Flask Tests

To run a Flask deployment tests, run the following command

```bash
python -m venv env  ==== to create venv

.\venv\Scripts\Activate ==== to active env

 Flask run  == python main.py

```

## Deployment

### Steps To Deploy The App:

Prepare your dataset:

        1. Data Extraction
        2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
        3. Feature Engineering
        4. Model Building and Tuning
        5. Building Flask API
        6. Pushing code to Github
